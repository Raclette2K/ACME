# ACME
For more informations : https://acme.raclette-it.com
## What is AMCE ?
ACME is an "autoclick", it can generate "clicks" like you'd do with your mouse but it can do it with a defined delay.
<br>Furthermore, you can define an interval for the delays like between 100ms and 200ms and it will randomize the delay every new click.
## How to use it ? 
It's pretty easy, select how you want to trigger ACME, how you want your delay (if it is constant or randomized) and finally select a key and apply changes !
<br>Now you just have to use the key you selected to trigger it.
<br>You can also select if it is a right or left click and even do a mouse wheel **scroll** (not button).

## Is it a cheat ? 
**IT IS NOT INTENDED TO BE A CHEAT !**
<br>You have no warranty whatsoever while using ACME
## Ok so what's the point of this ?
Well no point at all. Just a project I've made because I was bored and to improve myself in C++ because I'm just a High Schooler 
(and I want to precise that, of course, the code is not really the best you can have for this kind of project and I'm pretty sure 
there is a lot of problems in it)
## What does this repo contain ? 
This repository contains all the source code including the Visual Studio project file.
<br>If you want to modify the project be sure to use VS2017 and the Windows 10 SDK.
